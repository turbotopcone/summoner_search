Go to releases and download the .rar and just extract and run it within the folder, because the program is running on metro ui which is a framework on its own.

Create a shortcut and pin it to the taskbar for maximum functionality (that's how I am using it and it's convenient)

Start a game and when you get to champion select you will see in the chat something like:
TEST1 joined the lobby
TEST2 joined the lobby
TEST3 joined the lobby
TEST4 joined the lobby
TEST5 joined the lobby
Simply copy this and paste it in the program and click check op.gg; which will open up op.gg for each of them.

To see your opponents' winrates, you will have to wait for the game to start and then press check Porofessor.gg
